### Hello! Manuel here! ðŸ‘‹

  I'm studying programming at 42 Lisbon and currently work as a Fixed Income Portfolio Manager (what is that?? :neutral_face:) at Grupo Novo Banco GestÃ£o de Activos.

:books: Wager to learn about algorithms and programming, as much as i can

	Currently going full geek on C and C++ (high level assembly...? C++references==pointers PROVE ME WRONG)
	Excel, VBA (brah, i work in a bank, what do you think we use over here..)


Some hobbies:

	:guitar: Playing the guitar, air drumming, shower singing
	:angry: Casual Battlefield player
	Learning history from very reliable Wikipedia sources 	(:sweat_smile:)

That's it, feel free to take a look at my repos, mostly 42 projects :sweat_smile: FOR NOW :heart:

Cheerss
